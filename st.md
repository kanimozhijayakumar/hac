Ah okay Kanii! `npx` comes with **Node.js** â€” looks like it's not installed on your Mac yet. Letâ€™s get it fixed step-by-step ðŸ”§

### âœ… Step 1: Install Node.js & npm on macOS

1. **Check if Homebrew is installed** (your Mac's package manager):
```bash
brew -v
```

If you see version info, skip to step 2. If not, install Homebrew:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. **Install Node.js using Homebrew**:
```bash
brew install node
```

3. **Check if it worked**:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
npx -v
```

You should now see versions for all three. If yes âœ…, now you can run:
```bash
npx react-native init CareMapAI
```

Let me know if you'd prefer downloading Node.js via GUI (from the website), or if any step gives an error and Iâ€™ll guide you!
Sure, Kanii! Let's start step-by-step. First, weâ€™ll focus on setting up the **React Native app**. This will give us a base for everything else.

### **Step 1: React Native Setup**

1. **Open Terminal**: We'll create a new React Native project.
   ```bash
   npx react-native init CareMapAI
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project**: Move into the project folder.
   ```bash
   cd CareMapAI
   ```

3. **Run the App on Emulator/Device**: Test if the app works.
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios  # For iOS
   npx react-native run-android  # For Android
   ```

Once we confirm the app is running, we can integrate Firebase next. Ready to do this first?
